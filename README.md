# vgg-faces-utils
Script to download and annotate images from VGG Faces dataset


# Usage


### Download resources

Download VGG Face Dataset from it's home page:

http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face/

Or:

https://mega.nz/#!zeQSwC7D!aOBgSYkvldL6k91VdwKIx_EKS1J3_MQduPEU3QQ8g-o

You would get a file `vgg_face_dataset.tar.gz` that contains a `vgg_face_dataset` folder.


### Setup tools

```
git clone https://github.com/ndaidong/vgg-faces-utils.git

# extract compressed file into repo folder
tar -zxvf vgg_face_dataset.tar.gz -C vgg-faces-utils


cd vgg-faces-utils

# create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install packages
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

# start processing
(venv) ./script.py -d vgg_face_dataset/files -o output
```

The process may take several days depending on the connectivity.

It would try to download about 2.6 milions images from many resources.
However, we just expect to get about 1 milion.
Almost of links no longer available for right now.
